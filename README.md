# Andrew Campbell
Good morning/afternoon/evening; Here are a few of the projects I've been working on! Consider this a portfolio of sorts.

## Current Projects:

### Gratifly - Gratitude Journaling app for the modern era [\[Code\]](https://github.com/AndrewOCC/NoMoss-Makers-resilience)
Created at NoMoss Makers: Resilience, the goal of the project was to help people build resilience. We identified that encouraging a building a positive outlook through gratitude was a great way to do so, but that existing apps were too time consuming, and not rewarding enough to maintain user attention.

Our solution, Gratifly, is a gratitude journalling app designed around easy recording via text or voice, customised questions based on a user's perceived wellbeing, and a Google Photos-style discovery functionality that allows users to reflect on their past emotions and journal responses, when they have time to reflect.

### Overlap - Product Management and UI/UX Design   [\[Prototype\]](https://marvelapp.com/81a9580/screen/39081651).
Overlap is an in-development social travel platform originally pitched by Chris Pittard in a Digital Entrepreneurship class at USC. We are currently developing the business idea, getting customer feedback, and have built a clickable prototype in Marvel. I took up the role of designer for this project, and the clickable prototype I created can be found [here](https://marvelapp.com/81a9580/screen/39081651).

### Cardiac Output Monitor - iOS Development
I am currently a developer for an upcoming Cardiac Output Monitor device with an iPad head unit. I have been involved with fixing bugs, adding new features (including data export using AirDrop) and some basic UX work to improve the experience for medical professionals using the device.

### EventIO - Development and UI/UX Design
EventIO is an early-stage startup providing an event management platform for organisers and participants. I was asked to provide technical advice the team, and design an initial prototype for the web and iOS applications.

### Auralnauts - Unity Development
Auralnauts was a game created at the USC location of the 2018 Global Game Jam. Developed with Unity for Android devices, the game was entirely audio-based, with no on-screen interface. Players are the pilots of a damaged space-ship, and must use the gyroscope on their device to direct their ship, following radio transmissions to find their way back to earth.

The team was:
- Alex Lee - Developer
- Andrew Campbell - Developer
- Logan Stahley - Composer
- Tyrone Forte - Sound Editor
- Raymond Massa - Script Writer

You can view the GGJ project page [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/auralnaut). Development of additional features is still ongoing.

## Past Projects:
### Hackly
Hackly was a recruitment startup born out of Industrie IT's GradHack Hackathon. After winning the hackathon with our idea for an events platform

### Swiper   [\[Code\]](https://github.com/AndrewOCC/Swiper-Hackathon)
Swiper was created at the 2015 Freelancer API Hackathon, based off the default Android application (which displayed recommended Freelancer jobs in a list). My first real work with Android App development, I modified the app to display a list of cards, which users could swipe left or right to place in a list of 'not interested' or 'interested' tasks. Users could switch to either of these lists at any time and swipe these tasks 'back' into the main list, or delete/action them. The idea eventually would be to turn this app into a

### Circlet   [\[Code\]](https://github.com/AndrewOCC/SDD-Major-Project-Game)
Circlet was a 2D arcade game created in high school for a software design major project. Players play as a puck-shaped ship and tilt their phones to move it around the screen and defeat enemies. The application used the Google Play Games API for achievements and high scores.

This project was my first experience with Object Oriented Programming, Java and Android Development, which I taught myself for the project. Since then I have completed formal courses on Java and OOP.
